# To-Do-List

## Project Objetives
This project focused on building a To-Do List, our main objective is to apply the fundamental concepts of ReactJS and TypeScript in a practical and engaging manner. Through the creation of this task list application, we aim to deepen our understanding of the ReactJS component structure, comprehending how they interact to create a dynamic interface. Concurrently, we will integrate the basic principles of TypeScript, such as data typing and interfaces, to develop more robust code and prevent common errors. By the end of this project, we will be more confident in crafting functional web applications while reinforcing our knowledge of these essential front-end development technologies. In this project, we will create an application based on the design available on Figma, which can be accessed <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/CLaQYQpaafrhoQ8ddloAwT/ToDo-List-%E2%80%A2-Desafio-React-(Copy)?node-id=4130%3A478&mode=dev">here</a>.
